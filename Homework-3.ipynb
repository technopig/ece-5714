    "Describe the method that you use to generate 100 correlated Gaussian data points. One method will be to create a 100x100 covariance matrix C where the main diagonal elements are equal to 1 and the off-diagonal elements are equal to 0.5. Then apply a Cholesky factorization to the matrix C to get C = LL’, where L is a lower triangular matrix. Let y1 and y2 be two statistically independent vectors each containing 100 realizations drawn from N(0,1); use the Box-Muller method to generate these realizations. Let h1 = L y1 and h2 = L y2. Show that h1 and h2 contain 100 realizations drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero means, unit variances, and correlation coefficients of 0.5. Hint: calculate the covariance matrix E[h1 h2’]."
